# 💵 Bangladeshi Currency Recognition using VGG16 (Transfer Learning)

This project uses deep learning with transfer learning to classify Bangladeshi currency notes (Taka) across multiple denominations. A pre-trained VGG16 model (originally trained on ImageNet) was used to extract features, followed by a custom classifier head and fine-tuning for optimal performance.
